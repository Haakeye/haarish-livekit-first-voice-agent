# LiveKit Agents – First Voice Agent (Haarish)

## Overview
This repository contains my learning and first implementation of a
LiveKit voice agent as part of my internship. The goal is to understand
LiveKit Cloud basics, the LiveKit Agents framework, and how real-time
voice agents are built.

This repository serves as:
- A personal learning log
- A practical implementation reference
- A starting point for more advanced agent workflows

---

## Objectives
- Understand LiveKit Cloud fundamentals
- Set up a reproducible Python environment
- Build a basic real-time voice agent
- Follow clean repository and documentation practices

---

## Current Scope (Phase 1)
- LiveKit Cloud setup
- Environment setup using `uv`
- First working voice agent (Python)
